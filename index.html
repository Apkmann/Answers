        <p><b>3. Roles and Responsibilities of SDMA?</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) is responsible for formulating policies, plans, and guidelines for disaster preparedness, mitigation, and response at the state level. It coordinates with various departments, promotes capacity-building initiatives, and ensures effective communication to minimize the impact of disasters. SDMA plays a crucial role in facilitating and implementing disaster risk reduction strategies to enhance overall resilience within the state.</p><br>

        <p><b>6. Relevance of Indigenous Knowledge?</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indigenous Knowledge is being incorporated in modern engineering technology to produce viable structures in earthquake, flood and cyclone prone areas. Physical vulnerability of structures causes maximum disaster casualties. Hence, stress is also on retrofitting old structures with a view to making them disaster-resistant besides making new ones with disaster-resistant technology.</p><br>
        <p><b>7. Needs of Disaster Relief health?</b><br><div class="list"><ul><li>Rescue</li><li>Relocation</li><li>Provision Food and Water</li><li>Provision Emergency Health Care</li><li>Prevention of Disease and Disability</li><li>Repairing Vital Services e.g. Telecommunications, Transport</li></ul></div></p><br>

It informs strategic planning for effective disaster preparedness and risk reduction.</p><br>
        <p><b>9. Drought assessment?</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drought assessment involves evaluating the severity and impacts of prolonged water scarcity on agriculture, ecosystems, and communities, informing resource allocation and mitigation strategies to address the immediate and long-term consequences. It aims to enhance resilience and sustainable water management.</p><br>
        <p><b>10. Bhopal case study?</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bhopal gas tragedy occurred on December 3, 1984, when 45 tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas leaked from a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India. The gas mixed with water used for cooling and was released into the air. People began to feel sick, vomit, and have trouble breathing. Within minutes, many people died. The official death toll was 2,259, but by 1991, 3,928 deaths had been certified.</p><br>
